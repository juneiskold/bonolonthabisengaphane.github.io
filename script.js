    about: `
    Hello! I'm a creative developer focused on building engaging digital experiences.

    I believe in writing clean, efficient code and desingning intuitive user interfaces.

    My journey in tech began 5 years ago, and I've been passionate about combining
    aesthetics with functionality ever since.

    When I'm not coding, you can fine me exploring new technologies,
    or experimenting with creative coding.

    Feel free to explore my portfolio using the terminal commands!
